## Overview
Build a map directions web application that could add multiple routes and give you the most efficient path for all the total locations.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set daily routes
- Be able to modify daily routets
- cancel the route at any time.

### Links

- Live Site URL: Shut down due to API limitations and server cost.

## The process
This was a team effort with 3 other developers. We developed this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript utilizing the mapbox api. We at first split up the work where 2 of us worked on the backend and one on the front end, but eventually we all coded wherever we saw fit.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mapbx API
- Firebase (deployment)

### What I learned

This was the first project I had really worked with an API and was great experience at the time. Helped me to understand API calls and how to deploy websites live.

### Continued development

Once the semester was over, we were essentially keeping the application live out of pocket for the unversity so we decided to shut it down.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Mapbox API Documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com) - Definitely helped to look at the documentation to understand how to use the API.
- [Youtube](https://youtube.com) - Youtube has tons of content using the api so seeing how others developed their apps in their own ways helped.
